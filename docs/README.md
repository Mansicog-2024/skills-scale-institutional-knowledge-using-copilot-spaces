# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README is the entry point for OctoAcme's project management process documentation. It gives a short overview of how we run projects and direct links to the process documents in this folder.

## Brief overview of OctoAcme project management processes

OctoAcme runs projects using a customer-first, iterative, and data-informed approach with clear ownership and lightweight artifacts to enable fast, predictable delivery.

- Initiation: validate the problem, define measurable outcomes, identify stakeholders, and produce a Project One-pager to decide go/no-go.
- Planning: break approved initiatives into shippable increments, estimate work, define the Definition of Done, identify dependencies and risks, and create a release plan.
- Execution & Tracking: run iterative work with short feedback loops (standups, demos), use the project board and PR workflow, enforce CI/linting/tests, and track progress via velocity and dashboards.
- Risk & Communication: maintain a risk register, monitor and escalate blockers, and use structured stakeholder updates and templates for status and incidents.
- Release & Deployment: meet pre-release requirements, run automated staging and production pipelines, verify post-deploy, and have rollback/incident playbooks ready.
- Retrospective & Continuous Improvement: run regular retrospectives, convert learnings to action items, and track improvements in the backlog.
- Roles & Personas: each project has named roles (PM, Product, Developers, QA) with defined responsibilities and communication expectations.

These processes are lightweight and intended to be adapted to team needs while preserving consistent decision records and reducing single-person dependencies.
